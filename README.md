# Car_Price_Prediction_using_Tensorflow
A project to demonstrate creation of Neural Networks using Tensorflow framework and Keras API.

- Used a Kaggle Dataset to analyze the data of second hand car prices in the US.
- Trained various Neural Networks (using Tensorflow and Keras), experimenting with various number of hidden layers, neurons, optimizers, loss functions, etc.
- Optimized the Hyper-paramenters using GridSearchCV and generated the best estimator with R2 score of 99.81%
